                        <p>"How will you make your mark?"</p><p>This is a question Three Notch’d Brewing Co. asks its customers who flock to the local Valley Collab House just off East Market Street in Harrisonburg.</p> Originally opened in 2013 in Charlottesville, Three Notch’d left its mark in Harrisonburg just one year later in 2014 when it opened its second location just blocks away from City Hall.</p>To Head Bartender Andrew Shelley, just like how the Charlottesville location reflects its town just 60 miles away, Harrisonburg’s Three Notch’d will do the same.“This brewery needs to not represent Charlottesville,” Shelley said. “The way that was done was [by] hiring people here who represent Harrisonburg.”</p> <p>With craft beers on tap in several of the town’s local restaurants, Three Notch’d has become a go-to for some of the Valley’s craft beer enthusiasts. Aside from its various beers on tap, Harrisonburg’s Three Notch’d also has one distinction over every other brewery state-wide – it’s the first Virginia brewery to have a satellite location. </p>“What that means is, essentially, you have the main brewery and then they open a secondary location in another spot – this was the first one in Virginia to do that,” Shelley said. </p>Shelley acknowledges that while the different craft beers sold to the public are a great motivation to get out and travel for oneself, to him, the local businesses and those behind them are what the trail is all about. “I’ve been drinking in town before the beer trail was even a thing,” Shelley said. “I wouldn’t say it’s necessarily the Trail that keeps me going; for me it’s really about the people and supporting this community.”

                    <p>Special events also keep Three Notch’d going here in Harrisonburg. Some of which in the past have included cycling tournaments on stationary bikes at the brewery, weekly poetry readings during Pride Month and numerous JMU-related events.</p>
                    <p>For beer, Three Notch’d offers a diverse tap list ready to cater to a wide array of craft beer-lovers both in-house and on-the-go. The brewery currently has six flagship beers on-tap, such as its New England-IPA Minute Man beer and its Jack’s Java Espresso Coffee Stout, as well as nine seasonals. Some of them include the Passion Fruit Gose, which has a smooth and sour, yet fruity, taste, and the Jazzfest Sugarcane Pecan Ale – an American Amber/Red craft brew.</p>
                    <p>With its casual interior, revolving tap list, and friendly staff, the Three Notch’d Valley Collab House is always ready to open its doors and welcome in thirsty Trail-goers and Harrisonburg residents alike.</p>
                    <p>“This is almost like a foundational piece to Virginia beer,” said Shelley, smiling and manning the bar. </p>
