                        <p>No two beers are the same at Restless Moons Brewing.</p><p>Restless Moons Brewing, , makes beer for brewery lovers who are looking to try something new. From pilsners to IPA’s to sours, Restless Moons, located in Downtown Harrisonburg on Wolfe Street, brews small-batch and changes the recipe every time.</p><p>About a year ago the brewery created a pilsner called the Harrisonburger, which became so popular that it is now their flagship.</p><p>“It’s pretty easy, clean drinking, beer-flavored beer so people that come in that are looking to get into craft beer but don’t exactly know where to start, that’s always a good suggestion for them,” said Moon. </p><p>Pre-COVID you could find comedy shows and live music on the stage in the backyard. As the weather begins to warm up, Restless Moons plans on bringing live music back to their stage on weekends beginning in May. For now, there are new beers on the menu every week.</p>

                    <p>The atmosphere and brewing style is what Moon envisioned when he bought the brewery in 2017. When Moon came across a listing for a brewery called Wolfe Street Brewing, he was living in Washington D.C. and had an interest in homebrewing. Within a few months, Moon and his wife purchased Wolfe Street Brewing, and Restless Moons Brewing was born. Moon says of the name change, “If we were doing that we were going to put our mark on it as opposed to just continuing what someone else was doing.” The small batch brewing allowed Moon to evolve his style and try new things without having to worry about distribution.</p><p>Moon continues to brew creative craft beer and make a name for Restless Moons among the locals. The Shenandoah Beerwerks Trail brings in customers from out of town, and according to Moon, a lot of people from Pennsylvania.</p><p>“Randomly, I ran into someone who went to the same high school as me and she knew she knew my sister in high school so that was kind of a weird experience just because we are so far away and what are the chances of that happening?”</p>
